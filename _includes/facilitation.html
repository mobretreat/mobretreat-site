      <b>Like a coderetreat</b>, at the beginning of the first round each group decides 
      which programming language is used for writing code. 
      Each round has its specific constraints. 
     </p>
    <p>
    <b>Unlike a coderetreat</b>, the code is kept and incrementally developed by the mob 
      during the whole day. 
      Changing constraints relate to communication, not to the code. 
      The mob keeps most of their original members, but after each round one person per mob joins another mob.
